# TiledImageAnimations

Source files for the article on [Marcofolio.net](https://www.marcofolio.net/) called "[*Tiled image animations with Xamarin.Forms*](https://marcofolio.net/xamarin-tiled-image-animations)". The demo uses content from [PopOptiq](https://www.popoptiq.com/types-of-fireworks/) and relies on [FFImageLoading](https://github.com/luberda-molinet/FFImageLoading) to split the image. De demo works on iOS and Android due to using Xamarin.Forms.

Dive in the code or read the article to get more information about how this works.
